                            As of current, I am working on a project involving R programming. This
                            project is for the Alameda County Science Fair. We hope to create an
                            application that can use R programming to analyze the hand tremors caused
                            by Parkinson's in order to tell patients how their condition is progressing.
                            Currently, patients only get checked by doctor's about once every 6 months. They
                            are unable to get information about their condition any sooner. However, our
                            group has found an app on the App Store that will track "shaking" of the phone
                            It can send data about the shaking to a computer, via email, and our program,
                            on the computer, will analyze this data and give it in an easy-to-understand
                            format to patients and tell them if they need to visit a doctor. Also, it can
                            help with tracking the effectiveness of drugs that claim to help this condition.
                            You can view our team's daily log <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yCkKGDsCOzPZszYZSd7bvXb7OcPhvPeJtSFQIXHg7Y/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It contains information about our 
                            progress. This project is helping me understand what it feels like to work with a team.
                            It is also helping me to experience using a programming language that is unlike
                            anything else that I have been exposed to, previously.

                            My first complete project made in my high school's Computer Science class was created using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Scratch is a simple,
                            drag-and-drop style programming language. We were graded using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTrl28TOXmqEP6TLLnUhl9T41Ysyh0is-xitfgPvl7k/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> rubric. My documentation for this project is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13krLplCBvZvL60qU3p8hOx-jD2IpvkV71TwDk6hsSCg/edit">here</a>. It is a fantastic starting point for new programmers.
                            This was my first Scratch project in high school, however, I have been using Scratch for 5 years before this. 
                            I have made numerous games, and it has taught me many basic concepts about programming. These concepts include basic 
                            programming ideas such as varibles, algorithms, loops, if/else statements, and many other skills that any programmer
                            will need.
