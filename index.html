                        Ritvik has yet to decide exactly which field he wishes to
                        pursue. Being in high school, he wants to expose himself to
                        as many different career paths as he can before he makes a
                        concrete decision. However, he does have some idea of what
                        he wants to do. He has a desire to do something out of the
                        ordinary. He has interests in numerous fields, ranging from
                        Bioengineering to Gaming. He wants to continue to use his
                        Engineering skill and apply them to a newer field.
                </p>
                    <p>
                        His life as an engineer began in 5th Grade. He started
                        learning programing in Scratch, but quickly migrated to a
                        non-drag-and-drop program, Python. After spending about a
                        year honing his skills at Python, his dad decided it was
                        time for Ritvik to learn a more powerful language. And so
                        began the journey of constantly learning and trying to
                        master his skills at multiple languages. As of now,
                        Ritvik knows Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is continuing his journey by learning R program.
                        Ritvik has applied his skills by competing in FLL, the First
                        Lego League.
                        It is a Lego Robotics Competition that he has
                        partaken in for 2 years. He continues to support FLL by
                        coaching his younger sibling. He has moved on to a more
                        difficult platform by participating in his high school
                        Robotics Team which uses VEX Robotics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ritvik is continuing to hone his skills by joining the
                        Computer Science Elective at his high school. He plans to
                        keep learning more about programming, computers, and
                        engineering, in general. He has joined the Dublin High
                        School Robotics Team in order to learn about VEX Robotics
                        and apply his older Lego Robotics skills to a newer, more
                        challenging, competition. Other than direct engineering
                        skills, he has also gained many leadership and communication
                        skills. In John F. Kennedy Middle School, he was a part of
                        the school Leadership elective. He was tasked with managing
                        events such as dances, rallies, and other school events. He
                        was also elected as a Student Body Offices, the Historian,
                        in the 8th grade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ritvik has proven himself to be a brilliant student in his previous years of schooling, and will continue to do so in his years of high school. He has completed a few projects already and is currently working on a rather large one. This is available on his <a href="#Projects">Projects page</a>.

                            As of current, I am working on a project involving R programming. This
                            project is for the Alameda County Science Fair. We hope to create an
                            application that can use R programming to analyze the hand tremors caused
                            by Parkinson's in order to tell patients how their condition is progressing.
                            Currently, patients only get checked by doctor's about once every 6 months. They
                            are unable to get information about their condition any sooner. However, our
                            group has found an app on the App Store that will track "shaking" of the phone
                            It can send data about the shaking to a computer, via email, and our program,
                            on the computer, will analyze this data and give it in an easy-to-understand
                            format to patients and tell them if they need to visit a doctor. Also, it can
                            help with tracking the effectiveness of drugs that claim to help this condition.
                            You can view our team's daily log <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17yCkKGDsCOzPZszYZSd7bvXb7OcPhvPeJtSFQIXHg7Y/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It contains information about our 
                            progress. This project is helping me understand what it feels like to work with a team.
                            It is also helping me to experience using a programming language that is unlike
                            anything else that I have been exposed to, previously.

                            My first complete project made in my high school's Computer Science class was created using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. Scratch is a simple,
                            drag-and-drop style programming language. We were graded using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTrl28TOXmqEP6TLLnUhl9T41Ysyh0is-xitfgPvl7k/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> rubric. My documentation for this project is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13krLplCBvZvL60qU3p8hOx-jD2IpvkV71TwDk6hsSCg/edit">here</a>. It is a fantastic starting point for new programmers.
                            This was my first Scratch project in high school, however, I have been using Scratch for 5 years before this. 
                            I have made numerous games, and it has taught me many basic concepts about programming. These concepts include basic 
                            programming ideas such as varibles, algorithms, loops, if/else statements, and many other skills that any programmer
                            will need.

                            This is a powerful photo editing tool written in Python. It was designed for commercial/business use, and was made using the OpenCV, PIL, and Numpy libraries. It has a shell built in that allows the user to access any of the functions that it offers. It can do things like convert images to black and white, pixelate them, modify their saturation, give them a “warm” or “cool” effect, and place text on top of the image. This project was created in my 9th grade CSE class and was designed in cooperation with my partner. I learned a lot about Python and how to use libraries. It was difficult, at first, to learn how to use the different functions from the numerous libraries that we used, but in the end, it was worth it.

                                I taught a group of five 6th graders on how to build and program with EV3 Mindstorms. I prepared them for the First Lego League Robotics competition. I had to teach them how to build simple robots and introduce them to programming. All of them had little to no exposure to Engineering.
