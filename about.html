      <h1 class="title leftBorderBlue">Intro</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Hi, I’m Ritvik! I’m an 11th grader at Dublin high school. I am a member of my school’s Biomedical Academy and have a passion for the field of healthcare. I participate in a number of activities, both in and out of school, to further my knowledge for the medical field as well as skills that I think will be useful in that area. I am involved in a number of clubs that allow me to pursue my interest in the medical field, robotics, and a number of other topics. Keep reading to get a deeper dive into specific aspects of me. </p>
      <h1 class="title leftBorderBlue">Student</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">I have been at Dublin High school for 3 years now and absolutely love it. It has enabled me to challenge myself academically and take the rigorous courses that I desire. Currently, I am enrolled in AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science Applications, Honors Medical Interventions, Honors English, and U.S. History. I have a cumulative GPA of 4.0 and hope to increase it this year. I’ve enjoyed my classes so far and look forward to Junior year. In addition to the academic opportunities here, I’ve involved myself in a number of clubs at Dublin High. I am a member of HOSA (Health Occupation Students of American, Gael Force Robotics, and plan on creating my own club this year.</p>
      <h1 class="title leftBorderBlue">Programmer</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Programming is something that I’ve been doing since 4th grade and is a huge passion of mine. It’s like solving a puzzle or creating something entirely new, and I absolutely love it. You can view my <a class="generallink" href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see some of the stuff I’ve made. This site, for example, was programmed by me. I program for the school’s Robotics club (Gael Force Robotics), as well. I’ve been able to expand my passion for computer science by taking the Computer Science Principles course in 9th grade and I’m enrolled in AP Computer Science Applications this year to further my learning. </p>
      <h1 class="title leftBorderBlue">Martial Artist</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Another huge passion of mine is martial arts. I’m currently a First Degree Black Belt at West Coast World Martial Arts - Pleasanton. I’ve been learning martial arts since late elementary school, and it’s been a huge part of my life ever since. It’s allowed me to develop, not just physically, but mentally as well. I’ve been assisting my teacher by instructing smaller groups of younger students whenever possible and this has allowed me to develop as a leader and has greatly improved my self-confidence and teaching abilities, as well. </p>
